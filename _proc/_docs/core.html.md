# Machine Learning Homework

# Step 1: Setup

- run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Go to the file mnist.ipynb in nbs
- Run the first code block with the imports and make sure it is
  successful

# Step 2: Splitting the data

- Next we want to get the mnist dataset and split the data into a
  training and a testing set
- to do this, add the line
  `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()`
  to the next code block
- **x_train & x_test**: x_train and x_test are the mnist images
  themselves. They are represented as 28x28 2D arrays where each value
  is a number between 0, which represents the color white, and 255 which
  is black.
- **y_train & y_test**: The y values are the actual number that the
  image represents.

alt="In this image, the y value is the label and the x value is the image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">In this image, the y value is the label
and the x value is the image</figcaption>
</figure>

# Step 3: Visualize the data

- To visualize the 2D array, use the function matplotlib library
- Run the function `plotImage` to plot the data
- Change the index to see different numbers and images that are in the
  dataset

# Step 4: Reshape the data

- The neural network is expecting a 1D array, so we will need to reshape
  our data before we can train the model
- We currently have a 28x28 2D matrix for every value in the dataset. We
  need to reshape each value to be a single array with a length of 784
  containing all of the same values. ![’’](assets/reshape.png)
- To do this we do the following 
  `x_train_flat = x_train.reshape(NumberOfRows, NumberOfColumns)`
- **NumberOfRows**: Represents the number of rows in the new array. For
  this dataset, the number of rows should be the **length of x_train**
- **NumberOfColumns**: Represents the number of elements we want to
  represent each image, or **784**
- We need to reshape both x_train and x_test.
- The result will convert our array of 2D arrays we started with to an
  array of 1D arrays with the same values.
- You should have an x_train_flat and an x_test_flat variable

# Step 5: Train the data

- In the code, the model is already created for you, but you will need
  to train the model with the reshaped data
- In order to train the model, run the line `model.fit(x, y, epochs=5)`
- **x**: The x value from the training data. In our case, the x should
  be x_train_flat
- **y**: The y value from the training data. We can just use y_train for
  this value
- **epochs=5**: Specifies the number of times the model will go through
  the entire training dataset through the training process. Leave this
  parameter as is

# Step 6: Test and Evaluate Data

- Now that the model is trained, we can use our test dataset to evaluate
  how our model performs
- To test our model, add the line `model.evaluate(x_test_flat, y_test)`
  to the notebook in the provided block
- Running this line, we get an accuracy around 90% which means our model
  is very accurate
- Now we can visualize the accuracy using a confusion matrix to see
  which numbers are more commonly misclassified.
- Run the confusion matrix function at the end of the notebook. It
  should look like this:

<figure>
<img src="assets/confusion.png"
alt="The y-axis represents the actual number that the image is supposed to be and the x-axis is what the model predicted the image in the number to be. For example, the model predicted 61 of the handwriting images to be a 9." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The y-axis represents the actual number
that the image is supposed to be and the x-axis is what the model
predicted the image in the number to be. For example, the model
predicted 61 of the handwriting images to be a 9.</figcaption>
</figure>

After you produce this confusion matrix, push your code to github and
